1. combine mt and tgan

    ratios and learning rates

    rampup

    how to use data from g

    some baselines
        mt using triple-gan args
        triple-gan use mt args

    normalization

2. mt resnet
    normalization 
        order is not right

    batch_size. 256. 
        different
        label parallel
        bn

4. Triple-gan with resnet
    1. Memory is enough for bs 256 and its correspoding lr
    2. coefficient rampup (default sigmoid, 7w)
    3. pdl coefficient (default 3.0), adv fix to 0.03
    4. Use teacher or not (default True)


5. cifar100, stl 10 and svhn.
